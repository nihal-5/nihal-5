# Nihal Veeramalla

AI/ML Engineer building intelligent agent systems and production AI applications. Based in Raleigh/Cary, NC.

## Recent Work

Building multi-agent collaboration systems with AutoGen, LangGraph, and CrewAI. Focus on production deployments and real-world applications.

## Projects

### Multi-Agent Systems

**[AutoGen Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://github.com/nihal-5/autogen-collaborative-ai-agents)**  
4 specialized agents working as a team with real-time dashboard. Built with Microsoft AutoGen - agents actually debug each other's code which is pretty cool to watch.

**[AI Trading Simulation](https://github.com/nihal-5/ai-trading-simulation)**  
Multi-agent trading where 4 traders compete using different strategies. Testing GPT-4, Gemini, and Deepseek against each other on real market data. Fun to see how different models approach the same trades.

**[LangGraph Task Assistant](https://github.com/nihal-5/autonomous-task-assistant)**  
Autonomous agent that handles web browsing and code execution. Built with LangGraph's state machine approach. Uses self-evaluation to improve results.

**[CrewAI Research Assistant](https://github.com/nihal-5/ai-research-assistant)**  
Multi-agent research system with specialized researcher, fact-checker, and writer roles. CrewAI's hierarchical structure makes agent collaboration cleaner.

### Computer Vision

**[Real-time Video Analytics](https://github.com/nihal-5/video-query)**  
Ask questions about live video in natural language. Works with YouTube streams, webcams, and video files. Real-time object detection and scene understanding.

**[Product OCR Pipeline](https://github.com/nihal-5/automatic-product-creator-pos-erp)**  
YOLO + OCR for extracting nutrition facts, barcodes, and product images from packaging. Automates tedious e-commerce data entry.

### Automation

**[Email & WhatsApp MCP](https://github.com/nihal-5/My-Email-MCP)**  
Automated job application system using Model Context Protocol. Detects job postings, generates tailored resumes, sends WhatsApp notifications.
